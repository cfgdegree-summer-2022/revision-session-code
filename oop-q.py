REVISION TASK

1. Design a parent class Vehicle
    - Store the make and colour of the vehicle
    - Have a method called driving (where we’ll say by default it’s on 4 wheels)
2. Design a child class of Vehicle called Motorcycle
    - Needs to override driving (2 wheels)
    - Create a new method called coolFactor
3. Design a child class of Vehicle called Unicycle
    - Needs to override driving (1 wheel)
    - Create a new attribute - antique
    - Create a new method called coolFactor
